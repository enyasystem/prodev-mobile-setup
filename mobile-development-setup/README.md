# Mobile Development Environment Setup (Expo Go)

## Objective

The objective of this task is to set up and test a mobile development environment using the Expo framework for React Native development. This setup enables efficient testing of mobile applications directly on a physical device, reducing the need for heavy device emulators.

---

## Development Environment

The following tools were already installed prior to this task:

* **Operating System:** Windows / macOS / Linux
* **Node.js:** LTS version
* **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code

This task focuses specifically on installing and configuring **Expo Go** on a physical mobile device.

---

## Why Expo Go?

Mobile development requires testing across multiple device types and operating system versions. Managing emulators for all possible devices can be resource-intensive.

Expo Go provides a lightweight and cost-effective solution by allowing developers to:

* Run React Native applications directly on a physical device
* Avoid complex emulator configurations
* Test applications seamlessly on both Android and iOS

---

## Verification

The Expo Go application opened successfully and is ready to scan QR codes for running React Native applications from the development machine.

This confirms that the mobile development environment is properly set up and ready for upcoming projects.

---

## Challenges Encountered

No major challenges were encountered during the setup process.
The installation and login process was straightforward.
